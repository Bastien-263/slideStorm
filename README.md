## 🎯 The Project

**SlideStorm** revolutionizes presentation creation by enabling users to generate professional PDFs purely through conversational prompting. Simple, fast, and efficient.

### Problem Statement

Current AI-powered presentation generation tools struggle to follow existing templates and require excessive precision in prompts. Users often end up manually reworking almost everything anyway. SlideStorm solves this by seamlessly integrating with pre-designed templates and understanding your needs from natural conversation, delivering optimized slides without the endless back-and-forth.
